# My Workbook [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Xmary/Workbook.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Xmary/Workbook)
This project should result in Flask-Angular boilerplate or example project, which could be used for future projects. The main goal is to write minimalist and possibly beautiful code. Links to tutorials and examples, used in each commit, as well as official documentation, could be found from description of commits. 

## Description
### Tools and frameworks:
* [Flask microframework](http://flask.pocoo.org) for backend (i.e. without templates)
* [AngularJS framework](https://angularjs.org) for frontend
* [Github](https://github.com) for version control

## Possible problems with incorrect npm package installing
Use ```rm -rf node_modules/ workbook/static/bower_components/```
and ```npm install``` after that.
